Hi, I am Chrono, live in Hong Kong, China. I am self-learning python.
I really like to play card games (e.g. Yu-Gi-Oh!, Cardfight!Vanguard)
<br/>
My favourite card in Yu-Gi-Oh! --> <img src="https://ms.yugipedia.com//thumb/4/48/AvendreadSavior-MADU-JP-VG-artwork.png/275px-AvendreadSavior-MADU-JP-VG-artwork.png" width="300" align="right"/><br/>

I'm also making mods for Mindustry, these are the mods:
1. [***Nucleardustry***](https://github.com/Chrono-Heritage/Nucleardustry) <br/>: A mod that add nuclear releated items and blocks.
2. Metalindustry: A mod that add more metals and industry blocks. (Comming Soon!)

I'm still a student in middle school, so not really have much time for modding, so if you have any ideas or improvement for my mods,welcome to tell me!
